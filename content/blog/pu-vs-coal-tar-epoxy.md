# PU vs Coal Tar Epoxy for Pipelines

Polyurethane offers UV stability and flexibility, making it suitable for above-ground lines and areas with thermal cycling. Coal tar epoxy provides heavy-duty impermeability for buried service with strong resistance to soil chemicals.

## Selection Factors

- Exposure (buried vs exposed)
- Temperature range
- Chemical contact
- Application constraints and cure window
- Desired design life and maintenance plan

## Conclusion

Many projects pair PU or CTE with wrapping tapes for field joints to ensure continuous protection. [Request a coating recommendation](/contact).
