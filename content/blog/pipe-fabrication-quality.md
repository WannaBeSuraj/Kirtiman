# Quality Essentials in Pipe Fabrication

High-quality fabrication underpins coating performance. Dimensional accuracy, qualified welding, and thorough testing prevent defects from propagating into service.

## Key Controls

- Decoiling and cutting accuracy
- Rolling and fit-up verification
- Qualified WPS and welder performance
- UT and RT on longitudinal and circumferential welds
- Hydrostatic testing at 1.5x design pressure

Documented quality accelerates approvals and reduces rework. [Book fabrication and coating together](/contact).
