# What Is Corrosion and Why It Threatens Industrial Assets

Corrosion is the gradual deterioration of metal through chemical or electrochemical reaction with its environment. It drives billions in annual losses through failures, leaks, and downtime across industrial infrastructure.

## The Electrochemical Process

Corrosion needs an anode, cathode, electrolyte, and metallic path. When present together, metal ions leave the anode, electrons travel to the cathode, and damage localizes at the anode surface.

## Common Forms of Corrosion

- Uniform corrosion across large surfaces
- Galvanic corrosion between dissimilar metals
- Pitting corrosion creating localized holes
- Crevice corrosion in shielded areas
- Stress corrosion cracking from tensile stress plus corrosive media
- MIC driven by microorganisms

## Prevention Priorities

Select suitable materials, apply protective coatings, design out crevices and dissimilar contacts, control environment, and maintain cathodic protection where needed.
