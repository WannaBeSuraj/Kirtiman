# Industrial Pipe Coating Guide

Pipelines require internal linings and external coatings matched to fluid chemistry, soil conditions, and installation methods.

## Internal Protection

Food-grade epoxy, cement mortar lining, and high-solids epoxy reduce friction losses and resist disinfectants and MIC.

## External Protection

Polyurethane, coal tar epoxy, and wrapping tapes deliver impermeability for buried lines and UV resistance for above-ground runs.

## Field Joints

Heat shrink sleeves and primer-based tapes maintain continuity across welds, validated by holiday detection.

## Take the Next Step

Plan coatings alongside fabrication for better quality control. [Talk to our engineers](/contact).
