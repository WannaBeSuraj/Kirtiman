# Why Surface Preparation Determines Coating Life

Coating performance depends on clean, profiled steel. Abrasive blasting to Sa 2.5 removes rust, mill scale, and contaminants, creating an anchor profile for adhesion.

## Key Steps

1. Choose blasting media and pressure to achieve required profile.
2. Verify cleanliness before primer application.
3. Apply primer immediately to prevent flash rusting.
4. Inspect DFT and perform holiday detection where specified.

Proper preparation reduces rework, extends coating life, and lowers lifecycle cost. [Schedule surface preparation](/contact).
